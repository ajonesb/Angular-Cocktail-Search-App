# Angular Cocktail Search

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build --prod --base-href ./` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

- NOTE: You would not be able to view the index.html file on the dist folder. In order to view the content from the index.html, you must deploy to a server or install a server. 

- In this case, I just deployed directly to my hosting all the files on the dist folder to a sub folder (jonesfronteenwebdev.com/sub-folder) 

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

I have implemented some basic test functions with Protractor for the homepage.

The same methods can be reused for other components as well to continue testing.

To view the end-to-end functional testing please navigate to the following directories:

e2e -> src -> app.e2e-spec.ts and app.po.ts
